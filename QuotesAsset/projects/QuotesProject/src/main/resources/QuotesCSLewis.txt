"The hardness of God is kinder than the softness of men, and His compulsion is our liberation." -(C.S. Lewis)

"Evil is a parasite, not an original thing." -(C.S. Lewis)

"Try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free-wills involve, and you find that you have excluded life itself." -( C.S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain)

"Good and evil both increase at compound interest.  That is why the little decisions you and I make every day are of such infinite importance.  The smallest good act today is the capture of a strategic point from which, a few months later, you may be able to go on to victories you never dreamed of.  An apparently trivial indulgence in lust or anger today is the loss of a ridge or railway line or bridgehead from which the enemy may launch an attack otherwise impossible."  -(C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity)

"I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen:  not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else." -(C.S. Lewis)

"Miracles are a retelling in small letters of the very same story which is written across the whole world in letters too large for some of us to see." -(C.S. Lewis)

"Aim at heaven and you will get earth thrown in.  Aim at earth and you get neither." -(C.S. Lewis)

"No one ever told me that grief would be so much like fear." -(CS Lewis, A Grief Observed)

"Integrity is doing the right thing even when no one is watching." -(C.S. Lewis)

"In God you come up against something which is in every respect immeasurably superior to yourself. Unless you know God as that�and, therefore, know yourself as nothing in comparison�you do not know God at all. As long as you are proud you cannot know God."  -(C. S. Lewis)

"As St. Paul points out, Christ never meant that we were to remain children in intelligence: on the contrary. He told us to be not only �as harmless as doves�, but also �as wise as serpents�. He wants a child�s heart, but a grown-up�s head. He wants us to be simple, single-minded, affectionate, and teachable, as good children are; but He also wants every bit of intelligence we have to be alert at its job, and in first-class fighting trim." -(C.S. Lewis)

"Do not be scared of the word authority. Believing things on authority only means believing them because you have been told them by someone you think trustworthy. Ninety-nine per cent of the things you believe are believed on authority. ... We believe them simply because people who did see them have left writings that tell us about them: in fact, on authority. A man who jibbed at authority in other things as some people do in religion would have to be content to know nothing all his life." -(C.S. Lewis)

"I think all Christians would agree with me if I said that though Christianity seems at first to be all about morality, all about duties and rules and guilt and virtue, yet it leads you on, out of all that, into something beyond. One has a glimpse of a country where they do not talk of those things . . . Every one there is filled full with what we should call goodness as a mirror is filled with light." -(C.S. Lewis)

"People often think of Christian morality as a kind of bargain in which God says, �If you keep a lot of rules I�ll reward you, and if you don�t I�ll do the other thing.� I do not think that is the best way of looking at it. I would much rather say that every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different from what it was before. And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing either into a heavenly creature or into a hellish creature: either into a creature that is in harmony with God, and with other creatures, and with itself, or else into one that is in a state of war and hatred with God, and with its fellow-creatures, and with itself. To be the one kind of creature is heaven: that is, it is joy and peace and knowledge and power. To be the other means madness, horror, idiocy, rage, impotence, and eternal loneliness. Each of us at this moment is progressing to the one state or the other." -(C. S. Lewis)

"In the old days, when there was less education and discussion, perhaps it was possible to get on with a very few simple ideas about God. But it is not so now. Everyone reads, everyone hears things discussed. Consequently, if you do not listen to Theology, that will not mean that you have no ideas about God. It will mean that you have a lot of wrong ones�bad, muddled, out-of-date ideas. For a great many of the ideas about God which are trotted out as novelties today are simply the ones which real Theologians tried centuries ago and rejected." -(C. S. Lewis)

"Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently he starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of � throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself." -(C. S. Lewis)

"The Christian does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us.� -(C.S. Lewis)

"And let me make it quite clear that when Christians say the Christ-life is in them, they do not mean simply something mental or moral. When they speak of being �in Christ� or of Christ being �in them�, this is not simply a way of saying that they are thinking about Christ or copying Him. They mean that Christ is actually operating through them; that the whole mass of Christians are the physical organism through which Christ acts�that we are His fingers and muscles, the cells of His body. And perhaps that explains one or two things. It explains why this new life is spread not only by purely mental acts like belief, but by bodily acts like baptism and Holy Communion. It is not merely the spreading of an idea; it is more like evolution�a biological or superbiological fact. There is no good trying to be more spiritual than God. God never meant man to be a purely spiritual creature. That is why He uses material things like bread and wine to put the new life into us. We may think this rather crude and unspiritual. God does not: He invented eating. He likes matter. He invented it." -(C.S. Lewis)

"On the whole, God's love for us is a much safer subject to think about than our love for Him. Nobody can always have devout feelings: and even if we could, feelings are not what God principally cares about. Christian Love, either towards God or towards man, is an affair of the will. If we are trying to do His will we are obeying the commandment, �Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.� He will give us feelings of love if He pleases. We cannot create them for ourselves, and we must not demand them as a right. But the great thing to remember is that, though our feelings come and go, His love for us does not. It is not wearied by our sins, or our indifference; and, therefore, it is quite relentless in its determination that we shall be cured of those sins, at whatever cost to us, at whatever cost to Him." -(C. S. Lewis)
